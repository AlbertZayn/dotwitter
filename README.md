In the simplest case, an entry consists of text, a title, and additional data (such as an image). 
Also, access to the functionality of the site should be regulated using roles:
 - an anonymous person who can only view other people's public records
 - a reader who can do everything that an anonymous person can, and can also leave comments on posts
 - a writer who can do everything that a reader can, and can also create his own records
 - an administrator who can do everything a writer can, but can still edit users, block them or delete them.
Also, the administrator should be able to filter and search entries by various criteria, date, author, the presence of certain text inside the entry, etc., as well as sorting by publication date, number of comments, etc.
